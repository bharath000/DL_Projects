## Deep Learning Code Base for Tranining Models For Different Applications


### This Repo Consists of Deep Learning Code Base for Creating Custom Models, Data loaders, losses and Data Augmentations techiniques using PYTorch as the
the main framework for training, It is used to train models for Dectecting Diabetic retinopathy of fundas Images.: https://morning-anchorage-56517.herokuapp.com/adl.html

### Folder Structure:

<b>Models</b> Package for Developing Different Models <br>
<b>Losses</b> For Developing Different Loss functions<br>
<b>dataloaders</b> Customised Data Loaders <br>
<b> Custom Transformations </b>Developing custom Image Transformations for Data Augmentation on Fly<br>
<b> asved_models</b> To save the models strcture and its weights (Trainned)<br>
<b> utility </b> Code for Helper funtions Eg: Visualization of Data.<br>

### Infrastructure:
